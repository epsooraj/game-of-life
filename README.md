# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

## Life Death Conditions

Death
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

Survival

3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Birth

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
